# Getting Started

Learn how to integrate Pulse.

## 1. Add Frameworks

**Option 1 (Recommended)**. Add package to your project using SwiftPM.

```
https://github.com/kean/Pulse
```

Add both **Pulse** and **PulseUI** libraries to your app.  

**Option 2**. Use precompiled binary frameworks from the [latest release](https://github.com/kean/Pulse/releases).

## 2. Integrate Pulse Framework

**Pulse**Â framework contains APIs for logging, capturing, and mocking network requests, as well as connecting to the Pulse Pro apps.

### 2.1. Capturing Network Requests

**Option 1 (Quick)**. If you are evaluating the framework, the quickest way to get started is with ``NetworkLogger/enableProxy(logger:)``.

```swift
#if DEBUG
NetworkLogger.enableProxy()
#endif
```

**Option 2 (Recommended)**. Use ``NetworkLogger/URLSession``, a thin wrapper on top of `URLSession`. 

```swift
let session: URLSessionProtocol
#if DEBUG
session = NetworkLogger.URLSession(configuration: .default)
#else
session = URLSession(configuration: .default)
#endif
```

> Tip: See <doc:NetworkLogging-Article> for more information about how to configure network logging if your app is not using `URLSession` directly, how to further customize it, how to capture and display decoding errors, and more. Pulse is modular and will accommodate almost any system.

### 2.2. Collecting Regular Messages

To store regular log messages, use [LoggerStore](https://kean-docs.github.io/pulse/documentation/pulse/loggerstore).

```swift
LoggerStore.shared.storeMessage(
    label: "auth",
    level: .debug,
    message: "Will login user",
    metadata: ["userId": .string("uid-1")]
)
```

> info: As an alternative to using `LoggerStore` directly, you can use Pulse as a SwiftLog backend using [PersistentLogHandler](https://kean-docs.github.io/pulseloghandler/documentation/pulseloghandler/persistentloghandler) struct from [PulseLogHandler](https://kean-docs.github.io/pulseloghandler/documentation/pulseloghandler) which is a [Swift package distributed separately](https://github.com/kean/PulseLogHandler).  This way you can have more than one logger at once.

Logs are stored persistently and the store automatically removes old messages and limits the overall size (configurable). It uses a number of space [optimizations techniques](https://kean.blog/post/pulse-2#space-savings), including fast [lzfse](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/compression/algorithm/lzfse) compression.

## 3. Integrate PulseUI Framework

To view logs and network requests from your app, use [PulseUI](https://kean-docs.github.io/pulseui/documentation/pulseui/) framework. The framework is centered around a single screen: `ConsoleView`. On iOS, you can push it into the existing navigation stack or present it modally.

```swift
NavigationLink(destination: ConsoleView()) {
    Text("Console")
}
```

> Note: There are some additional steps required for some platforms. For more information see the PulseUI [documentation](https://kean-docs.github.io/pulseui/documentation/pulseui/).

## 4. Configure Remote Logging with Pulse Pro

In addition to the frameworks and the on-device view, Pulse also provides a separate professional macOS app called [Pulse Pro](https://kean.blog/pulse/pro) that you can use for viewing the previously shared logs or even viewing the logs from the device remotely in real-time.

To start using remote logging, there are a couple of extra setup steps:

### 4.1. Configure the App

Add the following to the app's plist file to allow it to use local networking:

```swift
<key>NSLocalNetworkUsageDescription</key>
<string>Network usage required for debugging purposes </string>
<key>NSBonjourServices</key>
<array>
  <string>_pulse._tcp</string>
</array>
```

> Note: There will be no user prompts unless you enable remote logging from settings.

### 4.2. Enable Remote Logging

Open the Pulse console from the app, go to Settings, enable "Remote Logging", and select a device running Pulse Pro to connect to.

Once the connection is established, open Pulse Pro and select the device in the sidebar. The next time you launch the app, the connection will happen automatically.
